# Data Availability

The data for all experiments is available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bk7yWuY_-Oheb5V3mRc9eSWrY2aKXMrx?usp=sharing). The data for the *Airfoil* and *Elasticity* experiments are provided by [Li et al., *Fourier Neural Operator with Learned Deformations for PDEs on General Topologies*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05209) and are also available in this [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YBuaoTdOSr_qzaow-G-iwvbUI7fiUzu8).

Please download the data and move them into this Data folder for correct paths with the default configs. If installed elsewhere, please specify the absolute paths in the configs.

Please note, the spherical shallow water equation experiment does not require data. This is generated in the loop.
