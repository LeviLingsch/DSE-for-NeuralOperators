# Data Availability

The data for the *Burgers* and *Shear Layer* experiment can be downloaded from the python files available in `_Data/Burgers` and `_Data/Humidity`. The data for the *Humidity* experiment may be downloaded from the shell script in `_Data/Humidity`, this requires a NASA EarthData account to download. Further instructions for getting started with NASA EarthData are available at this link: [https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/). The data for the *Airfoil* and *Elasticity* experiments are provided by [Li et al., *Fourier Neural Operator with Learned Deformations for PDEs on General Topologies*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05209) and are available in this [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YBuaoTdOSr_qzaow-G-iwvbUI7fiUzu8).

Please download the data and move them into this Data folder for correct paths with the default configs. If installed elsewhere, please specify the absolute paths in the configs.

Please note, the spherical shallow water equation experiment does not require data. This is generated in the loop.
