# Structured Matrix Multiplication



## Data and Pre-trained Models
The data has to be downloaded separately from the following location:
**TODOLINK**

Similarly, the trained models that we used in the paper can be found here:
**TODOLINK**


## Training

We formatted the models to be run easily from the `train.py` script. Select the model you wish to run (options `fno`, `sm`) and the according experiments (options `airfoil`, `humidity`).

The best hyperparameters are chosen by default, when the configs in `train.py` are left empty. These are defined in the separate model architectures of each experiment. You can choose to overwrite these by adding corresponding entries in the configs.
